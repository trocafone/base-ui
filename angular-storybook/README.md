# Storybook Component UI Development

This repo integrates some upstream features currently in development. You can find the latest Angular Storybook code in the following [branch](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/269-angular-support).

## Storybook Dev Server
Start the Storybook dev server with `npm run storybook`. Navigate to `http://localhost:9009/` to view your stories.

## Publishing your Storybook
You can publish your Storybook to `gh-pages` using the [Storybook Deployer](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook-deployer). Running `npm run storybook:deploy` will compile your Storybook's static assets and push them to your projects `gh-pages` branch.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
